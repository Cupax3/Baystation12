changes:
  - bugfix: Computer modules will now consume power as originally intended.
  - bugfix: Computers now die when you remove their batteries (as long as they don't
      have a tesla link to directly power them)
  - tweak: Tweaked battery depletion rates so that they don't discharge almost immediately.

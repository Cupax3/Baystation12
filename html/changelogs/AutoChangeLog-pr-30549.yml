changes:
  - bugfix: Sensor consoles will now print scans in the language that makes sense
      for their mapped areas.
  - rscadd: Modular console printers can now have their printing language configured
      in the 'Computer Configuration Tool' menu for the console. These languages are
      limited to what languages the user knows.
  - admin: A `set_language()` proc has been added to papers to allow for easier changing
      of a paper's language without dealing with VV, which likes to crash clients
      when editing the language var for some reason.
